# Sprint Drumshanbo - 2021-12-12
## Wins
- a working controller with two modules (titles and read)!
- a strong conception of our API (and some article ideas for Gabi)
- baseline typeswitch, currently using several separate views by design, plans to use library module for shared code later on
- We've updated to the latest nightly build 2021-12-11 03:55 UTC to mitigate log4j zero-day vulnerability

## Carryover
- Gabi is creating wireframe learning material based on our wireframe notecards
- Gabi is writing more guide .xql modules and their accompanying views

## Backburner
- none

## Concerns / Thrills!
- picking up the pace before 2022
- maps and svg will present some unique challenges
