# Sprint Dancing Sands - 2022-01-17
## Wins
- facets and fields are working. At our next meeting we'll decide what we should do with them.
- fix titles module and view. Working on applying changes to attributes next. Formalizing some functions in functions.xqm that will be used broadly.
- initial wireframe tutorial started, contributing site examples
- updated the call for application

## Carryover
- Gabi continuing wireframe learning material based on our wireframe notecards
- Gabi continuing guide .xql modules and their accompanying views
- David impeded on search interface

## Backburner
- Reading API issue (we want to wait for more eyeballs, specifically Hugh's). Whether we should use stuff/read/hammersmith_times_1804 or stuff/read?title=hammersmith_times_1804
- we need to breakdown documentation writing into smaller tasks next time we meet

## Concerns / Thrills!
- What are our short, mid, and long term goals? When should we aim to be "done" as it were with the application itself?

## Looking forward
- Sprint Rogue Pink Spruce @ 2022-01-22 at 3pm in person
- Design search interface + mockup main page next meeting
- Gabi to finish wireframe.md so David can review ahead of next meeting
- Gabi to revisit the controller documentation ahead of next meeting, so we can actually break down our documentation writing like we said we want to (http://dh.obdurodon.org/eXist-app.xhtml)
- David to email accepted participants regarding dates and commitment.
- David to circulate call for applications which we've updated here: https://pittsburgh-neh-institute.github.io/Institute-Materials-2020/call/
- David will contact Bill Campbell in a manner accessible to his own future self (not carrier pigeon,physical mail, or dream)
