# Sprint Monkey 47 - 2021-11-30 Lookback
## Wins
- wrapper.xql and lists.xql written and working
- way forward with the controller, writing some code
- committed to views first API structure
- generated some discussion-based lesson prompts
- we have a pretty comprehensive list of vaccine-requiring restaurants in the city

## Carryover
- Gabi is creating wireframe learning material based on our wireframe notecards
- Both to learn more about best practices for this API from "A world of fiction"

## Backburner
- David will learn about facets and fields, at some point in the future, when it becomes more immediately relevant

## Concerns
- picking up the pace before 2022

## Looking forward
- Sprint Drumshanbo - 2021-12-12
  - Gabi: read Bode, more guide .xql fields, learn about typeswitch from eXist-db book and XQuery for Humanists
  - David: implement controller so it talks to titles.xql, read Bode. implement the typeswitch library (copy from older code)
