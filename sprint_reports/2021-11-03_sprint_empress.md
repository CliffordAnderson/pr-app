# Sprint Empress 1908 Lookback
## Wins
- Cards scanned
- We both remembered more about controller writing than we thought we would
- We know how to serialize (make eXist serve HTML5 with XML syntax and correct MIME type)
- Realized it's about time to think about API design

## Carryover
- Gabi to write wrapper and article listing .xql files, to be adapted from previously written XSLT files
- Gabi is creating wireframe learning material based on our wireframe notecards
- David is continuing to learn about controllers, specifically w/r/t URL rewriting for API
- Both to learn more about best practices for this API

## Backburner
- David will learn about facets and fields, at some point in the future, when it becomes more immediately relevant

## Concerns
- None at this time

## Looking forward
- Sprint Monkey 47 - 2021-11-14
  - Gabi: write .xql and wrapper modules, write wireframe learning material, APIs
  - David: APIs and controllers
  - Gabi other to-do: find a restaurant with vax requirements and gin list (open on Sunday!)
