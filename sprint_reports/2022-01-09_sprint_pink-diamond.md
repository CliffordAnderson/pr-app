# Sprint Pink Diamond - 2022-01-09
## Wins
- controller.xconf has been added and unblocked David (kind of)
- verified that pre-install.xql is deploying our collection.xconf file to system effectively 
- verified lucene indexing is working
- Gabi understands our specific MVC structure now, and can write .xql modules + typeswitch views
- decided that using wrappers to pipeline our multi-item outputs is best, so we won't follow up on David's slack inquiry regarding data-typing for request:get-data()

## Carryover
- Gabi is creating wireframe learning material based on our wireframe notecards
- Gabi is writing more guide .xql modules and their accompanying views

## Backburner
- Reading API issue (we want to wait for more eyeballs, specifically Hugh's)
- we need to breakdown documentation writing into smaller tasks next time we meet

## Concerns / Thrills!
- picking up the pace *in* 2022
- maps and svg will present some unique challenges

## Looking forward
- Sprint Dancing Sands - 2022-01-16 @ 1pm (that's just 1 week! hoping to meet in person)
- David will implement facets and fields using new collection.xconf
- Gabi will create more .xql modules and view files, after fixing titles.xql
- Gabi to write wireframing documentation
- Gabi will email her employer's ethics board about getting paid for all this
- Gabi will either bring dinner or we'll order in :-)
- Next meeting: prep for our consult with Hugh regarding API structure + send inquiry
