    <h3>Filtering the article selection</h3>
    <p>The <i>Articles</i> menu link displays a list of article titles (to the right) and options to filter that
        list (to the left; click the <i>Search</i> tab above this User guide to display the search interface).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Term:</strong> Type a word into the Search term box and hit the Submit button to filter the
                articles list (on the right) to show only those that contain the specified word. Mouse over the
                circled letter <q>i</q> after the search box for information about other ways (more than just single
                complete words) to specify search terms, and visit the
                <a
                    href="https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_4/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package_description">Apache
                    Lucene
                    documentation</a>
                for additional details. If you edit the search-term box you need to click on the Submit button to
                update the display.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Publishers:</strong> Click on a publisher to select articles by that publisher. The selection
                updates automatically on each click and you can select as many publishers as you would like. If you
                don’t select any publishers, the articles list to the right is not filtered by publisher, which means
                that you implicitly select all publishers.</p>
            <p>Each publisher name is followed by two numbers, e.g. “Times, The (8/8)”. The second number, which never
                changes, is the total number of articles by that publisher in the corpus. The first number is the number
                of those articles included in the list to the right (if checked) or available for inclusion (by
                checking).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Dates:</strong> Date selection works like publisher selection except that it is hierarchical:
                you can select either an entire decade or a month+year combination within the decade. You can make as
                many date selections as you would like at either the decade or the month+year level of the hierarchy.
                The two numbers after each date item have the same meaning as with publishers, and, as with publishers,
                if you select no date values, you implicitly select all date values.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Terms, publishers, and dates are combined to filter the list of articles shown to the right and the search area
        to the left is updated to indicate meaningful search modifications. Publishers and dates are displayed in black
        or in gray; black means that checking the box will add articles to the list on the right and gray means that
        checking that box will not add any articles (although checking that box plus some others might add results). It
        is possible to select incompatible values (for example, only a single decade and only a publisher who published
        only in a different decade), in which case you can broaden your search to find matching values by selecting
        options that are colored black.</p>
    <h3>Selecting articles</h3>
    <p>There are three ways to interact with an article in the list to the right:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>If you <strong>hover over an article title</strong> the first words of the text will appear as a <q>tool
                    tip</q>. This can be useful for distinguishing articles that share titles and publishing
                information, such as the two different articles entitled <q>The Park Ghost</q>, both published on the
                same day in the same paper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you <strong>click on an article title</strong> you open a formatted reading view of the article,
                including summary analytic data below the text, followed by the original citation. If you entered
                any search terms to filter your articles list, those terms will be highlighted in the reading
                view.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you <strong>click on the colored box</strong> (<img src="resources/img/xml-link.svg"
                    alt="XML icon" />) at the end of an item in the articles list you open a view of the original TEI
                XML source for the article.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
