# A guide to making your first wireframes

## Materials

- colored pens/markers/crayons
- 1 hour of uninterrupted time
- notecards, a white board
- your phone

## Why do a wireframe now?
In product development, we use wireframes to give potential users, collaborators, and ourselves a concrete idea of how an application will work. We want to take every opportunity to explore the consequences and rewards of our intentions when we design something. By putting pen to paper first, you force your ideas' first confrontation with material limitations. This is something you should do early and often, as it will keep you from coding yourself into a corner. More importantly, it reveals your assumptions about what you want and don't want. If your wireframe aligns well with your research goals, you're likely to have a usable application at each stage of development.

## Why not make a detailed mockup?
Detailed mockups are really great when you need to make aesthetic choices, approach CSS, or for marketing the future-state of your application. They take a lot of time and mental energy. If you have eight interfaces, and you change one button on all of them in your mockup, it takes a lot of time to apply those changes.

Wireframes are intentionally light and adaptable. You do not want to fall down the rabbit hole of editing mockups in early drafting. We made one mockup using a tool called Lucidchart.

## Finding inspiration
For this wireframe exercise, I returned to some projects I admired to understand their approach to organizing information and presenting it to a user. I made three different wireframes inspired by the different pages, but adapted for the kind of information I want to present.

Early Modern Map of London (MoEML) is an "ongoing project...to map the spatial imaginary of Shakespeare's city". We want to look at this project because it shares some core methodology and technology (XML, mapping, licensing even).

Melville Electronic Library ,"when fully realized, MEL’s “textual core” will consist of a set of integrated scholarly digital editions treating each Melville work as a “fluid text,” that is, any written work that exists in multiple versions resulting from authorial, editorial, or adaptive revision."
